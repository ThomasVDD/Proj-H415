# Servo Motor
The idea is to be able to control the servo motor. First, a servo object was created to control this. Then a position is initialized to store the motor position. Pin 9 of the microcontroller is attached to the servo object to get the the motor position. In the main loop, two for loops are written. The first one for the foward rotation(0째 to 180째-clockwise direction) and the other loop(180째 to 0째- Anti-clockwise direction).
